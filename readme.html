    <h2>Description</h2>
	
	<p>Template Blocks is a visual template engine, created with the logic of the web designer in mind and is aiming to help you create web templates easier and faster.</p>

	<p>Being this an early version it may be rough around the edges and a set of features and improvements are left to be included in following releases.</p>
    
	<p>Having said that, it is a functional template engine which we hope you enjoy using and embrace it as a useful tool for your everyday web designing.</p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
	
	<p>Installing/upgrading should be as simple as uploading/overwriting the files on your server and running the setup process.</p>
	
	<p>To initiate the setup process just run your web browser and direct it to the domain of your website.</p>
	
    <p>Before anything else, be sure that your server meets the minimum requirements (PHP 5, MySQL) and that you have already created the database you are going to use for this engine.</p>
	
	<p>After the setup is complete you can log in to the administration interface at: <br /> <a href="template/admin.php">http://www.yourdomain.com/template/admin.php</a></p>
	
    <h2>Support</h2>
	
	<p>There are a number of things you can do beyond the basic setup.</p>
